    //Using the class CourseOffering, which you created in Assignment 2, add objects to the ArrayList in Courses. The UML for the classes is below.

//-courseList: ArrayList
//+searchByName(string):CourseOffering
//+searchByNumber(int):CourseOffering

    //searchByName and searchByNumber need to be implemented using a binary search(This means that you will want to insert your data into the list in-order).
    //If the search is unsuccessful the method needs to throw an exeption that you have defined.
    // CourseOffering: ArrayList
    //+SearchByName(String):CourseOffering
    //+SearchByNumber(int):CourseOffering
